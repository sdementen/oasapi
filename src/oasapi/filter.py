     - returning
        - False if the operation does not match the condition
        - the operation (modified to match the condition) if it matched a condition

    The flags on_XXX specifies if the given criteria should be actively matched or not (it is useful
    if one wants to selectively filter according to criterias while keep√Æng the same conditions.

    The flag merge_matches drives the behavior of the operation matching and adaptation.
    When an operation is matched to a condition, the operation will be adapted to the condition.
    For instance, if a condition has a tags=["tag1"] and the operation has tags=["tag1","tag2"], it
    will be matched by this condition and the operation is transformed to only have tags=["tag1"].

    When we have multiple conditions matching the same operation, the operation will be tranformed differently
    for each condition. If the flag merge_matches is False, it will return the operation transformed by the
    firtst matching conditions (or False if none of the conditions match the operation). If the flag
    merge_matches is True, all conditions will be tested on the operations and the transformations of the operation
    for each matching conditions will be merged.
    For example, if we have an operation with tags=["tag1","tag2","tag3"] and
     two conditions [FilterCondition(tags=["tag1"]),  FilterCondition(tags=["tag2"])], with
      - flag_matches=False, the resulting operation will have ["tag1"] (as first match is on tag1)
      - flag_matches=True,  the resulting operation will have ["tag1","tag2"] (as both conditions matches,
        each returning its operation transformed, i.e. ["tag1"] for the first and ["tag2"] for the second,
        and the results are merged in a single operation, giving ["tag1","tag2"]
